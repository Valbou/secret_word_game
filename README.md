A little game for fun where you need to discover a hidden word.
You have 10 attempts to find it, letter by letter.
If a letter is in the word, that letter appears for each occurrence in the word.
Otherwise, you lose an attempt.

The code was written to show some possibilities of Python language to new programmers.
